      <h2>About Elephant
      </h2>
      <p>Elephant is a 4 year old Pembroke Welsh Corgi. Unfortunately, he is not related to any of the royal corgis.
        He can be very mischievous but can be lazy at he same time. He snores really loud and likes to hog the bed.

      <h3>About Pembroke Welsh Corgis</h3>
        <h4 class="flashy">Appearance</h4>
        <p>The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has erect ears, and proportional to the equilateral triangle of the head. They should also
          be firm, medium in size, and tapered slightly to a rounded point. The head should be foxy in shape and appearance.
          Pembroke Welsh Corgis differ from the closely related Cardigan Welsh Corgi by being shorter in length, having smaller
          ears, and being slightly straighter of leg. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has a "fairy saddle", somewhat lighter markings
          on each side of the withers caused by changes in the thickness, length and direction of hair growth. The Pembroke Welsh
          Corgi sheds mostly in the spring and fall and may shed annually, with intact females shedding during heat.
          <br><br>
          Many breed faults exist, some which may acknowledge genetic health conditions: "Fluffies" are Corgis which have very long
          coats, and "bluies," are a dilute color. In a "bluie," red coats seem to have a bluish cast.
          <br><br>
          Some Pembroke Welsh Corgis are born with a natural docked tail. Others may have their tails docked between 2&ndash;5 days old due
          to historical tradition or as a measure of confirmation to the Breed Standard . Artificial docking was born of necessity
          given the Pembroke's function as a herding dog in the United Kingdom. According to Tax Law any companion canine was considered
          a luxury. Thus, pet/companion owners were levied a tax. However, dog owners who kept dogs for working purposes such as herding
          were exempt from the tax. In order to claim the exemption, owners had to ensure that the dogs sported docked or bobbed tails.
          The Kennel Club, the United Kennel Club, and the FCI allow intact tails in Conformation shows. The AKC Standard states
          tails should be docked no longer than 2 inches (5 cm). In many countries, docking has been deemed illegal.

          <h4 class="flashy">Temperment</h4>
        <p>Pembroke Welsh Corgis are very affectionate, love to be involved in the family, and tend to follow wherever their
          owners go. They have a great desire to please their owners, thus making them eager to learn and train. The dogs are
          easy to train and are ranked as the eleventh smartest dog in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs. Besides herding,
          they also function as watchdogs due to their alertness and tendency to bark only as needed. Most Pembrokes will seek
          the attention of everyone they meet and behave well around children and other pets. It is important to socialise this
           breed with other animals, adults and children when they are very young to avoid any anti-social behavior or aggression
           later in life. Due to their herding instinct, they love to chase anything that moves, so it is best to keep them inside
           fenced areas. The herding instinct will also cause some younger Pembrokes to nip at their owners' ankles.

         <h4 class="flashy">History</h4>
        <p>The Pembroke Welsh Corgi lineage has been traced back as far as 1107 AD. It is said that the Vikings and Flemish weavers
          brought the dogs with them as they traveled to reside in Wales. As far back as the 10th century, Corgis were herding
          sheep, geese, ducks, horses and cattle as one of the oldest herding breed of dogs.
          <br><br>
          Pembroke Welsh Corgis are closely related to Schipperkes, Keeshonds, Pomeranians, Samoyeds, Chow Chows, Norwegian Elkhounds
          and Finnish Spitz. Pembrokes and Cardigans first appeared together in 1925 when they were shown under the rules of The
          Kennel Club in Britain. The Corgi Club was founded in December, 1925 in Carmarthen, Carmarthenshire. It is reported that the
          local members favored the Pembroke breed, so a club for Cardigan enthusiasts was founded a year or so later. Both groups have
          worked hard to ensure the appearance and type of breed are standardized through careful selective breeding. Pembrokes and
          Cardigans were officially recognized by the Kennel Club in 1928 and were initially categorized together under the single heading
          of Welsh Corgis, before the two breeds were recognized as separate and distinct in 1934.
          <br><br>
          Pembroke Welsh Corgis are becoming more popular in the United States and rank 24th in American Kennel Club registrations, as of 2012.
